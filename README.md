# The Crazy Scale

Earthquakes have the Richter scale.

Tornados have the Fujita scale.

Even Chillis have the Scoville scale.

It's time Crazy had its own scale, because quite frankly, 'Bat Shit' and 'Is Strong' are not sufficient to differentiate between the subtle nuances of various types of Crazy.

# Periodic Table of Crazy

Since its inception, several properties of the individual states of Crazy have been discovered. For example some states seem to decay into one or more states, whilst other states seem to combine into compound states.

This is not unlike elements, which both combine to form molecules, also decay under nuclear fission into different elements, or undergo nuclear fusion to form new elements.

Part of the development of the Crazy Scale will be to explore how far this similarity goes, and whether it is possible to start building a Periodic Table of Crazy to support a kind of Crazy Chemistry, or Crazy Nuclear science; maybe even a Crazy Cosmology...
